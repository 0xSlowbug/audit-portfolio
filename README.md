# 🧪 Private Firm Experience 
## Quill AI

In addition to public contests, I bring practical private-sector experience from working with **Quill AI** as an **AI Tool Testing Intern**, contributing to the development and improvement of several production-grade security tools.

During this period, I:

* Tested **QuillShield AI** across diverse protocols, benchmarked its detection capabilities against auditors of different experience levels, and provided recommendations that shaped **QS v2 and v3**.
* Evaluated **QuillCheck**, an AI token scanner, ensuring its accuracy in detecting contract vulnerabilities, market risk patterns, honeypots, liquidity traps, and other token-level risks.
* Helped refine **WachAI Chat**, an AI chatbot for token scanning, and its **Twitter bot**, uncovering UX issues, logic inconsistencies, and accuracy gaps.
* Worked on the **WachAI Agent** (Virtuals ACP), testing its performance across:

  * ERC-4626 compliance checks
  * Token analysis and metadata accuracy
  * Audit reasoning and correctness
  * Prompt engineering and model guidance
  * Automation reliability across edge cases

These contributions directly improved the accuracy, robustness, and reasoning depth of the tools.
